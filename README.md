# Build Checker 

A special-purpose fork of [Raise My Hand]https://github.com/brunocalado/raise-my-hand-plus by the excellent [brunocalado](https://github.com/brunocalado). 

The eventual goal of this fork is to quickly poll whether all players are "in" or "out." When the timer expires, all players that are not "in" are "out." 

## Build Checker Buttons
Two buttons are planned:
1. (Swinging Pick Icon) - I am building
2. (X Icon) I am not building

## Keybindings
Planned keybindings will be `B` for Build and `N` for not build. 

Optional: Might also try to bind a double-click on an empty spot on the map background as build, and double-right click as not building.

## Settings
Main planned setting is to be able to configure the amount of time for the countdown.

## Features
- A small pick icon will appear next to the player name if you are building
- A small cross icon will appear next to the player name if you are not building
- A (temporary) notification will be displayed to all users when someone decides to build (or not build)
- A sound will be played. You can set the sound and volume. - maybe?
- A message will be sent to the chat stating that the player is building (or not building).
